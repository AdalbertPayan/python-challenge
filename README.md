All source for data was found either from office hours or Bills lectures, the activities for 03-Python were super helpful

All code was tested in Visual Studio Code successfully,
all code was pushed and added to GitHub from Visual Studio Code using the cloning method.

I did receive some help from Simon Rennecks (tutor) in PyBank, he helped me figure out why I was getting the wrong number for average, 
this is documented within the code, he also helped me get the Analysis to populate correctly.
I was using open.ai to try to figure out why I was getting the wrong data for average but it was not helpful at all.

I did not use any outside resources to write this code.

Thank you, 

Best, 

Adalbert
